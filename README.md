Introduction to Git:

Version control is like a time machine for your code, allowing you to track changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous states.
Git offers numerous benefits, including decentralized collaboration, easy branching and merging, and robust version history.
Basic Git concepts include repositories, commits, branches, and remotes.
Setting Up Git:

Configure your identity (git config --global user.name "Your Name" and git config --global user.email "your@email.com").
Initialize a new repository (git init) or clone an existing one (git clone <repository_url>).
GitHub:

Create a GitHub account and repository to host your Git projects.
Git Basics:

git init: Initialize a new Git repository in the current directory or a specified folder.
git status: Check the current status of your repository, including changes and untracked files.
git add: Stage changes for the next commit, either all changes (git add .) or specific files.
git commit: Commit staged changes with a descriptive message.
git remote: Set up connections to remote repositories.
git push: Push committed changes to a remote repository.
Collaborating with Git:

Clone a repository (git clone <repository_url>).
Create a branch:
git branch <branch_name>: Create a new branch.
git checkout <branch_name> or git switch <branch_name>: Switch to a branch.
git checkout -b <branch_name>: Create and switch to a new branch.
List branches: git branch
Delete a branch: git branch -d <branch_name> or git branch -D <branch_name> for force deletion.
Merge branches: git checkout <target_branch> followed by git merge <source_branch>.
Rebase branches: git checkout <feature_branch> followed by git rebase <main_branch>.
Resolve conflicts: Use git mergetool or manually edit conflicting files.
View commit history: git log
